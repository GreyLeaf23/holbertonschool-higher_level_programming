# How to open a file?

To open a file, you can use the built-in *open()* function:
```ruby
file = open("filename.txt", "r") # You can replace "filename.txt" with the desired file.
```
In the *open()* function, the first argument is the name of the file to open and the second argument is the way (mode) that you want to open the
file, in this case, we're opening it on *READ* mode.
